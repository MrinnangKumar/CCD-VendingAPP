This is a project which I got from my current company. 
A Full-stack application having basic functionality to store data, documents, profile picture, where you can login & logout. 
I used the MongoDB, Express Js, React (TSX), Node Js (MERN). I built an API which helped me store & retrieve data from the backend. 
In this application I made a tabular format where Machine Details, Client, Status of Machines & ID can be stored.
